# AI Course Directory Source Code

This is the source code for the course directory created for my AI course. You will find the source code here if you are interested in seeing how the site works or to confirm the privacy policy.

You will be able to access the actual site [here](https://moaesaycto.github.io/ai-games).

The course codes will be access via an environment variable, so they are not available in this repository. Please do not use this code unless you or your child is enrolled in the course.
